PROJECT TITLE: Sorting and Searching Algorithms | BSTs && HASHING

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implement sorting and searching algorithms on ocean data. Also, implement binary search trees and hashing algorithms on the same data.

DATE: June 2022

AUTHORS: Spyros, Kallinikos

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Run from powershell:
For part 1
>> gcc sort_dates.c -o sd
>> .\sd
>> gcc 1.c -o 1
>> .\1
>> gcc 2.c -o 2
>> .\2
>> gcc 3.c -o 3
>> .\3
>> gcc 4.c -o 4
>> .\4
For part 2:
>> gcc sort_dates.c -o sd
>> .\sd
>> gcc sorted_unique.c -o su
>> .\su
>> gcc final.c -o fin


Note:
The position that results from executing 3.c and 4.c from part 1 starts counting from 0 and ignores the first row of the csv file. So if when executing 3.c and the terminal says that a date is found in possition 445 then in the csv file it will be in line 447.
